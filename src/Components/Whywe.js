            <p>When I was preparing for SSB the problems which I faced like don't know from where to start and how to understand SSB flow so at that time  I don't have any idea that How much role current affairs plays in SSB how to tackle SRT,WAT,etc so I don't have any proper guidance for that..so now after getting recommend in my first attempt i know how to tell other about the SSB flow so we decided to start a Whatsapp group to help in your preparation from start to end.
</p>
            <hr style={{borderTop: '3px solid #833fb2', width: '100%'}}/>

<h5>Why monthly fees : 100rs</h5>
<p>Want you to achieve that Plus on your chest number.We really want to help others thats why we want people who really working towards their aim and will take part seriously because that feel of preparing for SSB have its own value.So we just keep 100rs entry in Group(for per month), Because we dont want that due to someone(who just join for fun) will ruin all others preparation to overcome that only we make a entry fees.


And we can understand too that you cant trust us without demo so thats why our batch which will start from 1st May will be free for demo for first three days.Try it if u like it then only continue.

Hope we will see you soon and join now before the group gets filled.(Separate group will be created for Girls)</p>
